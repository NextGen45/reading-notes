Adding Remotes
To create a new remote Git repository with a short name, use the following format:

git remote add shortname url
Example:

$ git remote

origin

$ git remote add js https://github.com/janesmith/project1

$ git remote -v

origin https://github.com/johndoe/project1 (fetch)

origin https://github.com/johndoe/project1 (push)

js     https://github.com/janesmith/project1 (fetch)

js     https://github.com/janesmith/project1 (push)
This addition of these remote and short names allows you to use shortnames for Git collaboration.

Fetching
Fetching entails pulling data that you donâ€™t have from a remote project.

Here is the command format:

git fetch [remote-name]
